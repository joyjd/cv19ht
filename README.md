## CV19HT

This website was a social contribution of mine during the pandemic of COVID19. At that point of time, many states in India were in succumbing state to provide Covid19 medical treatment to Covid patients due to the huge number of increasing infected patients each day. Moreover, based on the scenerios, I realised that there was a gap between the information of hospitals/medical centers who are providing covid care and the patients. As a result, many patients due to lack of proper knowledge were not able to commute to the proper hospitals which have empty beds in time and get proper treatment. The list of hospitals who are providing covid treatment and their status of empty beds were updated in Government health website each day statewise. Hence, I built this website to filter the data and showcase the available hospitals based on the user location on the go. The aim was to provide available hospital data to the patient while the patient is out of home and searching for an available medical center. In this mobile-first responsive website, I have made extensive use of in built navigation properties and Google api for location. This website traces the user's current location based on ip adress of the device and gets the physical address from Google api and displays the same. Along with that, it filters the available hospitals which are seggregated zonewise via my custom alogorithms and displays the one which are available in the same physical proximity of 5km radius of the user location. Once the user location gets changes as the user moves, the entire hospital filter process is recreated and the relevant data is displayed to the user. This website also helps in tracking the real-time availability of ambulances in the same user location and emergency doctors with their relevant contact data based on Google data api's. This website was used by many to get proper treatment in quick manner avoiding disaster scenerios.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
